== Description ==

Plugin to make qTranslate work with WooCommerce. No more need to duplicate forms for each language.

In order to use you need both qTranslate and WooCommerce installed.

After it is installed, you can use the qTranslate quicktags (see http://www.qianqin.de/qtranslate/forum/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=3&p=15#p15) for your category names, etc.

e.g. if you use "[:en]Test product[:de]Test-Produkt[:lb]Test-Produit" as a category name, qTranslate - with the help of this plugin - will automatically choose the correct language (in this example either English, German or Luxembourgish) when displaying the category name.

To report a bug or contribute to the plugin, please create an issue at the project page on GitHub: https://github.com/mweimerskirch/wordpress-qtranslate-support-for-woocommerce

I won't answer to requests in the support forum.
